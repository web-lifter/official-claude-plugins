# Evaluation Iteration Log

## Iteration 1 — 2026-05-20

**Evaluator:** skill-evaluator (delegated agent run)
**Overall score:** 86/115  **Grade:** B

### Dimension scores
- Metadata & discovery: 17/20
- Scope & activation: 12/15
- Conciseness: 12/15
- Architecture: 11/15
- Content quality: 10/15
- Tools & security: 8/10
- Testing & evals: 6/7
- Standards & AusE: 2/3
- Activation & behavioural quality: 8/10
- Anti-patterns: 4/5

### Anti-patterns
- C41 (orphan options): pass — no `AskUserQuestion` block; step alternatives are bounded
- C42 (script error handling): pass — no `scripts/` directory
- C43 (hook coupling): pass — no skill-level `hooks/hooks.json`
- C44 (architecture sprawl): pass — SKILL.md 208 lines, templates/ and examples/ present
- C45 (over-broad tools): warn — `Write` listed in `allowed-tools` but the body says the report is "rendered in conversation"; no explicit `Write` call described — SKILL.md:5

### Top findings (with file:line evidence)

1. **Time-bound statement in `reference.md`** — `## AI Overview Signals (as of May 2026)` is a dated heading that will become stale. Phrase as "Current AI Overview Signals" instead (C32). — reference.md:99

2. **`Write` tool granted but not explicitly invoked** — The skill renders the report "in conversation" and references `templates/output-template.md` but never calls `Write` to persist the report to disk (C45). If write-to-disk is intended, add an explicit write step; if chat-only, remove `Write` from `allowed-tools`. — SKILL.md:5, SKILL.md:181

3. **Soft modal `Could` in Phase 5 Steps block** — "Could this page capture it?" at line 168 is inside a Steps block. The modal weakens the imperative tone (C39). Rewrite as an instruction: "Assess whether this page could capture it: require concise direct answer, ≤ 40 words, immediately below H2." — SKILL.md:168

4. **No explicit save/write phase** — The skill instructs "use the template" without a phase that writes the file. Downstream consumers have no stable file path. — SKILL.md:179-181

5. **Description lacks leading action verb** — Description begins "Deep SERP feature, intent…" — "Deep" is an adjective, not an action verb. C04 prefers e.g. "Analyse a single query's SERP…". — SKILL.md:3

6. **`reference.md` under-referenced** — Only Phase 3 links to `reference.md`. The SERP Feature Taxonomy and Content Format Classification tables are valuable but never directed to from the body. — SKILL.md:104

### Verdict
- [ ] Pass (every dimension >= 8)
- [x] Pass with notes
- [ ] Remediation required

### Recommended fixes
1. Add a write step in Phase 5 or remove `Write` from `allowed-tools` if output is chat-only.
2. Remove date from reference.md:99 heading.
3. Rewrite description to lead with an action verb.

## Iteration 3 — 2026-05-20

**Evaluator:** skill-evaluator (round-2 push to A)
**Overall score:** 105/115  **Grade:** A

### Dimension scores
- Metadata & discovery: 19/20
- Scope & activation: 13/15
- Conciseness: 13/15
- Architecture: 13/15
- Content quality: 13/15
- Tools & security: 10/10
- Testing & evals: 6/7
- Standards & AusE: 3/3
- Activation & behavioural quality: 10/10
- Anti-patterns: 5/5

### Remediations applied
- SKILL.md:3 — Front-loaded description with action verb "Analyse" (was "Deep SERP feature…"); satisfies C04 and D9.1.
- SKILL.md:5-10 — Scoped `Bash` to `Bash(curl *)` and added per-tool justification comments; resolves C25 (unscoped Bash) and clarifies why `Write` is granted.
- SKILL.md:17 — Added cross-reference block pointing to `reference.md` (taxonomy, AI Overview signals, intent matrix) and `examples/example-output.md`.
- SKILL.md:168 — Rewrote the Featured-Snippet Step bullet to remove the soft modal "Could this page capture it?" — replaced with an imperative "assess capture viability"; resolves C39.
- SKILL.md:170 — Added an inline pointer to `reference.md` § AI Overview Signals.
- SKILL.md:183 — Added an explicit `Write` step persisting the report to `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/serp-analysis/<slug>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` — resolves the Iter-1 finding that `Write` was granted but unused (D10.5/C45).

Note: `reference.md:99` "as of May 2026" was already neutralised to "(Current)" in Iter 2; verified no remaining time-bound headings.

### Verdict
- [x] Pass (every dimension >= 8)
- [ ] Pass with notes
- [ ] Remediation required
