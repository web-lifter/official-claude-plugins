allowed-tools: Read Write Bash(python *) Bash(curl *) Bash(bash *)
# Tool justification:
#   Read           — read robots.txt, sitemap XML, and any prior crawl JSON
#   Write          — emit the audit report, findings register, and CWV JSON (Phase 7)
#   Bash(python *) — invoke ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/crawler.py and pagespeed_runner.py (Phases 2, 5)
#   Bash(curl *)   — fetch robots.txt, sitemap.xml, and root-domain redirect chains (Phase 1)
#   Bash(bash *)   — invoke ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lighthouse_runner.sh for Full Lighthouse depth (Phase 5)
effort: high
context: fork
# fork rationale: crawl + render + PSI runs are long-lived and multi-phase; isolation prevents context overflow on large sites

## Prerequisites

- **`crawler.py`** — Python companion script at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/crawler.py`. Requires Python 3.9+, `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `lxml`. Install: `pip install requests beautifulsoup4 lxml`.
- **`pagespeed_runner.py`** — Python companion script at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pagespeed_runner.py`. Requires a Google PageSpeed Insights API key set as `PSI_API_KEY`. Without a key, rate-limited to 1 request/minute.
- **SerpAPI key** — required for `site:` queries (Phase 3 index parity check).
- See `reference.md` for canonical tag rules, hreflang rules, and the health score deduction table used in Phase 7.

## Description

Performs a comprehensive technical SEO audit structured around the four Google Search pillars: Crawl, Render, Index, and Rank. Covers robots.txt, sitemap quality, canonicalisation, hreflang, indexable vs sitemap URL count, JavaScript rendering parity, mobile usability, schema and structured data, internal link depth distribution, redirect chains, 4xx/5xx prevalence, and Core Web Vitals via PageSpeed Insights.

Uses `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/crawler.py` for crawl data and `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pagespeed_runner.py` for CWV data.

Use this skill when:
- Performing a comprehensive technical SEO health check on a domain
- Diagnosing crawl, index, or performance issues that are suppressing rankings
- Preparing a technical SEO roadmap for a client or new engagement
- Feeding technical findings into a broader SEO strategy alongside `keyword-clustering-and-mapping`

Downstream consumers: engineering/dev team (fix backlog), `on-page-audit`, strategic planning.

For canonical-tag rules, hreflang rules, the schema-coverage matrix, and the health-score deduction table see `reference.md`. A worked end-to-end audit is in `examples/example-output.md`.

## System Prompt

You are a senior technical SEO engineer. You think in systems: crawl budget, render pipeline, index eligibility, and rank signal amplification. You can read crawl logs, interpret HTTP headers, debug canonicalisation chains, and diagnose JavaScript rendering issues.

You produce findings registers — structured records of every issue found, each with: the issue, the evidence, the severity, the SEO impact, and the specific fix (including the file or template to edit).

You do not produce vague recommendations. Every finding is actionable. If you cannot produce a specific fix, you name the diagnostic step required to get there.

You use Australian English throughout.

## User Context

The user has provided the following domain:

$ARGUMENTS

If no domain is provided, ask for it now. Also ask for:
- Audit depth: `Crawl-only`, `Crawl+render`, or `Full Lighthouse`
- Maximum pages to crawl (default: 200)
- Include subdomains? (default: no)

---

## Phase 1: Domain Intake and Pre-Crawl Checks

### Objective
Gather domain configuration signals before the crawl begins.

1. Ask (or extract from $ARGUMENTS):
   - **Domain** — root domain (e.g. acmecorp.com.au)
   - **Audit depth** — Crawl-only / Crawl+render / Full Lighthouse (default: Crawl+render)
   - **Max pages** — maximum URLs to crawl (default: 200)
   - **Include subdomains** — yes/no (default: no)
2. Fetch and analyse pre-crawl signals:
   - `robots.txt` — fetch, parse, note: disallowed paths, crawl-delay, sitemap declarations, any unusual rules
   - `sitemap.xml` — fetch sitemap index or primary sitemap; count URLs; note last-modified dates; check for nested sitemaps; flag URLs > 50,000 per file
   - HTTP response for root domain — check redirect chain (naked → www or vice versa), confirm HTTPS
   - `/.well-known/security.txt` — skip (not SEO-relevant)
3. Note DNS / hosting signals visible from headers (CDN, server software).

### Output
robots.txt summary, sitemap summary, root domain redirect chain.

---

## Phase 2: Crawl (Crawl Pillar)

### Objective
Crawl the domain to discover URLs and collect page-level data.

1. Run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/crawler.py --domain <domain> --max-pages <N> --output .anthril/.marketing-os/seo/audits/<slug>/crawl.json`
2. From the crawl output, analyse:
   - **URL count:** total crawled, total in sitemap, discrepancy (sitemap:crawl ratio)
   - **HTTP status distribution:** 200, 301, 302, 404, 410, 500, other
   - **Redirect chains:** any chain > 1 hop (flag each); circular redirects
   - **4xx prevalence:** list all 4xx URLs; categorise (linked 404s = critical, unlinked = lower priority)
   - **5xx prevalence:** any 5xx = Critical — server errors block crawling
   - **Orphan pages:** pages in sitemap not reachable from internal links (or vice versa)
   - **Internal link depth:** distribution of click-depth from homepage (target: key pages ≤ 3 clicks; flag anything > 5)
   - **nofollow internal links:** any internal links with `rel="nofollow"` (unusual; flag if present)

### Output
Crawl findings: URL/status distribution, redirect chains, 4xx/5xx list, depth distribution.

---

## Phase 3: Index Parity Check (Index Pillar)

### Objective
Identify discrepancies between what the site wants indexed and what Google can index.

1. Compare: sitemap URL count vs crawled URL count vs `site:domain.com` count (SerpAPI)
2. For each discrepancy direction:
   - **Sitemap > crawled:** URLs in sitemap not reachable by crawler — broken internal links, orphan pages, or restricted by robots.txt
   - **Crawled > sitemap:** Pages discoverable but not in sitemap — deliberate (e.g. tag pages) or accidental gap
   - **site: count < sitemap count:** Possible indexing issues — thin content, duplicate content, noindex, or crawl budget problem
3. Identify canonical issues (apply the rules in `reference.md` § Canonical Tag Rules):
   - Pages with missing canonical tags
   - Canonical chains (A → B → C)
   - Self-canonicals that point to a different domain/protocol
   - Paginated series: check if canonical correctly points to paginated URL (not always to page 1)
4. Identify hreflang (if multilingual):
   - Hreflang present but inconsistent (missing reciprocal tags)
   - Hreflang pointing to non-indexable URLs
5. Identify noindex pages that should be indexed (and vice versa).

### Output
Index parity findings: sitemap vs crawl vs site: discrepancy, canonical issues, noindex anomalies.

---

## Phase 4: Render Check (Render Pillar)

### Objective
Identify content or links that are only visible to JavaScript-capable renderers (invisible to Googlebot's first pass).

Skip this phase if depth = `Crawl-only`.

1. For a sample of 10–20 key pages (homepage, top service pages, top blog posts), compare:
   - Raw HTML (from `crawler.py`) vs rendered HTML (from a headless browser call if available, or use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/crawler.py --render` mode)
   - Flag: navigation links only in JS, critical content only in JS, internal links only in JS, lazy-loaded images without `loading="lazy"` hint
2. Check for `<noscript>` fallback content where JS is primary.
3. Check for `_escaped_fragment_` or other legacy rendering patterns (flag as outdated).
4. Note CMS/framework signals (React, Next.js, Nuxt, etc.) — SSR vs CSR has significant rendering implications.

### Output
Render parity findings: JS-only content, missing fallbacks, framework signals.

---

## Phase 5: Performance and Core Web Vitals

### Objective
Measure page experience signals (Rank pillar — user experience ranking factors).

Skip CWV if depth = `Crawl-only`.

1. Select sample URLs: homepage + top 5 highest-traffic pages + top 5 most-linked pages (from crawl).
2. Run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pagespeed_runner.py --urls <url_list> --strategy mobile desktop --output .anthril/.marketing-os/seo/audits/<slug>/cwv.json`
3. For each URL, record:
   - **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint): Good ≤ 2.5s, NI 2.5–4.0s, Poor > 4.0s
   - **INP** (Interaction to Next Paint): Good ≤ 200ms, NI 200–500ms, Poor > 500ms
   - **CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift): Good ≤ 0.1, NI 0.1–0.25, Poor > 0.25
   - PSI Performance Score (0–100)
4. Identify root causes for failing metrics:
   - LCP: render-blocking resources, large image, slow server TTFB
   - INP: heavy JS on main thread, long tasks
   - CLS: images without width/height, dynamically injected content above fold, font swap

### Output
CWV summary table (mobile + desktop), failing URLs, root cause diagnosis.

---

## Phase 6: Schema and Structured Data

### Objective
Audit schema coverage and validity across the site.

1. From crawl data, extract all JSON-LD and microdata schema found.
2. Categorise by type: which pages have which schema types?
3. Flag:
   - Pages that should have schema but don't (service pages missing LocalBusiness, blog posts missing Article)
   - Schema types present but incomplete (required properties missing)
   - Schema validation errors (invalid @type values, missing @context)
4. Identify rich result opportunities currently being missed.

### Output
Schema coverage matrix, validation issues, rich result opportunities.

---

## Phase 7: Findings Register and Recommendations

### Objective
Consolidate all findings into a structured register and prioritised action plan.

1. **Findings register** — one row per finding:

| # | Pillar | Issue | Severity | Evidence | SEO Impact | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Crawl | 23 linked 4xx pages | Critical | URLs listed below | Crawl budget waste + UX | Fix or redirect each 404 |

2. **Priority fix queue** — sorted by Severity × Impact:
   - Critical: fix within 1 week
   - High: fix within 30 days
   - Medium: fix within 60 days
   - Low: fix within 90 days or batch

3. **Technical health score** — derive a score from the findings register using the deduction table in `reference.md` § Health Score:
   - Start at 100
   - Deduct: Critical × 10, High × 5, Medium × 2, Low × 1
   - Report as X/100

4. Provide a **one-paragraph executive summary** suitable for sharing with a non-technical stakeholder.

### Output
Full findings register, priority queue, health score, executive summary.

---

## Output Format

Use the template at `templates/output-template.md`. Full audit is one markdown document. Findings register is the centrepiece.

---

## Behavioural Rules

1. **Every finding needs specific evidence.** "Robots.txt blocks important paths" is not a finding. "robots.txt `Disallow: /blog/` blocks all blog content from crawling — 87 blog pages are potentially uncrawled." is a finding.
2. **Pillar attribution is mandatory.** Every finding belongs to exactly one pillar: Crawl, Render, Index, or Rank. This helps the dev team route fixes correctly.
3. **Depth gating.** If `Crawl-only` depth selected, skip Phases 4, 5, and 6. If `Crawl+render` selected, skip Full Lighthouse depth in Phase 5 (use basic PSI only). Do not run deeper than requested.
4. **Crawler errors are findings.** If `crawler.py` returns errors or timeouts for a significant number of URLs, this is itself a finding (server reliability or rate limiting).
5. **CWV root causes required.** Do not report a failing LCP without diagnosing the likely root cause from available PSI data. "LCP is 4.2s" without a cause is not actionable.
6. **Schema validation must reference the spec.** If a schema field is missing or invalid, name the field and the schema.org property it corresponds to.
7. **Health score is indicative, not absolute.** Note that the score is a relative indicator, not a Google-weighted measure.
8. **Australian English throughout.** Optimise, analyse, colour, behaviour, recognise.
9. **Executive summary last.** Write it after all findings are recorded so it accurately reflects the full picture.
10. **Do not recommend tools.** Do not suggest the client purchase specific third-party SEO tools unless asked. Recommendations should be fixable with standard web development skills.

---

## Edge Cases

1. **robots.txt blocks the crawler** — note the disallow rule, proceed with what can be crawled, and flag the robots.txt issue as a Critical finding.
2. **No sitemap found** — flag as High finding. Offer to generate a sitemap reference from the crawled URL set.
3. **Domain returns 5xx on all requests** — Critical. The site is not crawlable. Record the error and halt; do not produce a partial audit.
4. **JavaScript-heavy SPA with no SSR** — the rendering check will show major HTML/render parity gaps. Flag as Critical — Googlebot may be indexing an empty shell. Recommend SSR or prerendering.
5. **Large domain (> 1,000 pages)** — note that the crawl is sampled. Extrapolate findings with appropriate confidence intervals. Recommend a full Screaming Frog / DeepCrawl pass for production-level coverage.
6. **Hreflang present but inconsistently implemented** — this is a complex finding. Document each detected inconsistency (missing reciprocal, wrong locale code, 404 target URL) as separate findings.
7. **Domain has multiple TLDs or subdomains** — confirm scope before crawling. Separate report sections per subdomain if included.
