## Testing Instructions

**Google Rich Results Test:**
1. Go to https://search.google.com/test/rich-results
2. Select "Test code snippet"
3. Paste the JSON-LD block above
4. Expected: `LocalBusiness` and `FAQPage` both appear as detected types with no errors

**Schema.org Validator:**
1. Go to https://validator.schema.org/
2. Paste the JSON-LD block
3. Verify: `CafeOrCoffeeShop` and `FAQPage` types validated correctly

**Live page testing (after deployment):**
```
https://search.google.com/test/rich-results?url=https://cremalane.com.au
```

## Implementation Notes

- Place the entire `<script type="application/ld+json">` block in the `<head>` element of the page, ideally near other `<meta>` tags
- The `hasMap` value should be replaced with the actual Google Maps share link for the business
- The `aggregateRating` values (`ratingValue: 4.7`, `reviewCount: 312`) must reflect real review data — do not inflate these figures as this violates Google's structured data guidelines
- FAQ rich results typically appear within 1–2 weeks of deployment after Google's next crawl
- If the café ever changes hours (e.g. holiday trading), update `openingHoursSpecification` promptly — outdated hours in schema will generate a mismatch warning in Search Console
