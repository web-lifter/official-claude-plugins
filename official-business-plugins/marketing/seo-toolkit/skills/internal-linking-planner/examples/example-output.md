## Implementation Guidance

### Priority 1 — Complete First (this sprint)

Work page-by-page through the source URLs with Priority 1 items. Batch by source page to minimise CMS editing sessions:

1. **/hiking-boots-australia** (hub): Add 3 missing spoke links in the appropriate sections (wide-fit boots, waterproof boots, hiking socks). ~15 min edit.
2. **/waterproof-hiking-boots**: Add hub link in intro. ~5 min edit.
3. **/hiking-boots-wide-fit**: Add hub link in intro. ~5 min edit.
4. **/best-hiking-socks**: Add hub link. This is an orphan — also verify it's included in the XML sitemap. ~10 min.
5. **/sleeping-bags-australia** (hub): Add temperature-guide spoke link in the "How to Choose" section. ~10 min.
6. **/sleeping-bag-temperature-guide**: Add hub link. Verify sitemap. ~5 min.
7. Continue through remaining Priority 1 items in the same pattern.

### Priority 2 — Next Sprint

- Complete hub-to-spoke and spoke-to-hub links for the Navigation & Safety and Trail Running clusters (currently 40% and 67% complete respectively)
- Add 4 cross-cluster hub-to-hub links (Boots ↔ Clothing, Tents ↔ Sleeping, Navigation ↔ Tents, Kitchen ↔ Packs)

### Priority 3 — Ongoing

- Add contextual within-cluster spoke-to-spoke links during content updates
- Review anchor text variation across the Hiking Boots cluster — currently 3 links use the exact phrase "best hiking boots Australia"; reduce to 1
