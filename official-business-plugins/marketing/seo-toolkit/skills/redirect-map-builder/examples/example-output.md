## Server Config — nginx (Sample)

```nginx
# Redirect map for outdoorhaven.com.au → Shopify migration
# Generated 15/05/2026
# Auto-accepted matches only (confidence ≥ 0.85)

server {
    # PATTERN RULES — apply first (most efficient)

    # WooCommerce products → Shopify products
    location ~* ^/product/(.+?)/?$ {
        return 301 /products/$1;
    }

    # WooCommerce categories → Shopify collections
    location ~* ^/product-category/(.+?)/?$ {
        return 301 /collections/$1;
    }

    # Blog path restructure
    location ~* ^/blog/(.+?)/?$ {
        return 301 /blogs/guides/$1;
    }

    # Pagination → parent collection
    location ~* ^/page/\d+/?$ {
        return 301 /collections/all;
    }

    # Shop root
    location = /shop/ { return 301 /collections/all; }

    # INDIVIDUAL URL OVERRIDES (slug-matched; override pattern rules where needed)

    # Category name changes
    location = /product-category/clothing/ { return 301 /collections/outdoor-clothing; }
    location = /product-category/footwear/ { return 301 /collections/hiking-footwear; }

    # Static pages

    location = /contact/ { return 301 /pages/contact-us; }
    location = /terms-and-conditions/ { return 301 /pages/terms-of-service; }

    # Specific product overrides (slug changed in new site)
    location = /product/north-face-thermoball-jacket/ { return 301 /products/the-north-face-thermoball-eco-jacket; }
    location = /product/msr-hubba-hubba-2-tent/ { return 301 /products/msr-hubba-hubba-nx-2-person-tent; }

## Redirect Chain Issues

The following 14 redirects must be updated before deployment:

| Old URL | Current Target | Final Destination | Fix Required |
|---|---|---|---|
| /hiking-gear/ | /product-category/hiking/ | /collections/hiking-gear | Update direct: `/hiking-gear/` → `/collections/hiking-gear` |
| /sale-items/ | /product-category/sale/ | /collections/sale | Update direct: `/sale-items/` → `/collections/sale` |
| /outdoor-clothing/ | /product-category/clothing/ | /collections/outdoor-clothing | Update direct |
| /trekking-poles/ | /product/trekking-poles/ | /products/trekking-poles | Update direct |

*(10 additional chain items in full redirect map CSV)*

**Action:** Update the `new_url` field in `redirect-map-outdoorhaven.com.au-2026-05-15.csv` for all 14 chain rows before deploying the nginx config.
