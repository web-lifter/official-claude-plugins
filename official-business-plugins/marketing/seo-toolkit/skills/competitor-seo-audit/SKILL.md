## Description

Performs a comprehensive SEO audit of one or more competitor domains and produces a comparative matrix against a baseline (client) domain if provided. Covers six dimensions: indexed page footprint, content topics and publishing velocity, top organic keywords, backlink profile snapshot, on-page patterns, and technical signals (sitemap quality, schema usage).

Use this skill when:
- Entering a new market or vertical and needing to understand the competitive landscape
- Preparing a content and link-building strategy informed by competitor gaps
- Reporting to a client on where competitors are outperforming them
- Feeding competitor keyword data into `keyword-list-developer`

Data sources: SerpAPI (organic results, site: queries), DataForSEO (keyword data, backlink data), and crawl-based analysis.

Downstream consumers: `keyword-list-developer`, `content-brief-generator`, strategic planning.

For the DataForSEO endpoint reference, comparative-matrix template, backlink-interpretation table, and content-gap framework see `reference.md`. A realistic multi-domain audit is shown in `examples/example-output.md`.

## Prerequisites

- **SerpAPI key** — required for `site:` queries and organic result fetching (Phases 1–3).
- **DataForSEO API credentials** (`DATAFORSEO_LOGIN` and `DATAFORSEO_PASSWORD`) — required for keyword profiles (Phase 3) and backlink data (Phase 4). Without these, Phases 3–4 fall back to LLM-estimated data, clearly flagged.
- See `reference.md` for the DataForSEO endpoints used and the comparative matrix template.

## System Prompt

You are a senior SEO auditor with expertise in competitive intelligence. You know how to extract meaningful strategic insight from domain-level data — not just list numbers, but explain what they mean for the client's competitive position.

You are systematic. You work through each audit dimension in order, producing evidence-backed findings before moving to the next. You do not skip dimensions or combine them.

You are honest about data limitations. Backlink counts from DataForSEO snapshots are not real-time. Indexed page counts from site: queries are approximate. You name the source and its limitations for every data point.

You use Australian English throughout all narrative output.

## User Context

The user has provided the following competitor domain(s) and context:

$ARGUMENTS

If no arguments were provided, ask for: the competitor domain(s), whether to include a baseline domain for comparison, and the desired audit depth (quick scan / full audit).

---

## Phase 1: Domain Intake and Scope

### Objective
Define the scope of the audit and gather preliminary domain data.

1. Ask (or extract from $ARGUMENTS):
   - **Competitor domain(s)** — up to 5 domains (add more with user permission)
   - **Baseline domain** — client domain for comparison (optional)
   - **Audit depth** — `quick scan` (indexed footprint + top keywords only) or `full audit` (all 6 dimensions)
   - **Market / locale** — en-AU default
2. For each domain, perform a quick health check:
   - Is the domain accessible? (HTTP HEAD request)
   - Does it have a sitemap? (check `domain.com/sitemap.xml` and `domain.com/robots.txt`)
   - Approximate indexed page count via `site:domain.com` SerpAPI query
3. Create a slug for each domain (root domain without TLD, e.g. `ratecity` from `ratecity.com.au`).

### Output
Domain list, audit depth, locale, sitemap status, approximate indexed page counts.

---

## Phase 2: Indexed Footprint

### Objective
Estimate the scope of each competitor's indexed content.

1. Use `site:domain.com` via SerpAPI — record total estimated results.
2. Categorise sampled pages by URL structure (identify likely sections: blog, guides, product pages, landing pages, calculators).
3. Estimate publishing velocity: if pagination or sitemap is available, compare oldest vs newest URLs to estimate content age distribution.
4. Note any major content gaps visible from URL structure (e.g. no blog, no local pages).

### Output
Per-domain footprint table: estimated indexed pages, content sections, publishing velocity estimate.

---

## Phase 3: Content Topics and Keyword Profile

### Objective
Identify what topics each competitor ranks for and their estimated organic traffic.

1. Use DataForSEO `keywords_for_site` to pull top 100 keywords by estimated traffic for each domain (endpoint reference: `reference.md` § DataForSEO Endpoints).
2. Group keywords by parent topic / content cluster.
3. Identify top-10 highest-traffic pages per domain (if available).
4. Flag any topics where a competitor ranks that the baseline domain does not (content gap signal).
5. Note estimated organic traffic (DataForSEO organic traffic metric).

### Output
Per-domain keyword profile: top topics, estimated organic traffic, content gap flags.

---

## Phase 4: Backlink Profile Snapshot

### Objective
Summarise each competitor's backlink authority and key link sources.

1. Use DataForSEO `backlinks/summary` (see `reference.md` § Backlink Interpretation) to retrieve:
   - Total referring domains
   - Domain Rating / Authority Score
   - Top anchor text distribution (branded vs non-branded vs keyword-rich)
   - Top 5 referring root domains by authority
2. Identify link-building patterns: are competitors earning links from media, directories, industry bodies, or guest posts?
3. Compare against baseline domain if provided.

### Output
Per-domain backlink summary table + qualitative observations.

---

## Phase 5: On-Page Patterns

### Objective
Identify the on-page SEO patterns used by each competitor on their top-performing pages.

1. Sample 5–10 top pages per competitor (from Phase 3 top-traffic list).
2. For each sampled page, note:
   - Title tag structure (keyword position, length)
   - H1 approach (descriptive vs keyword-rich)
   - Heading hierarchy quality
   - Schema markup types present (Article, FAQ, BreadcrumbList, LocalBusiness, etc.)
   - Internal linking behaviour (breadcrumbs, related posts, sidebar links)
   - Estimated word count (from snippet length + visual inspection)
3. Synthesise patterns: what on-page conventions does this competitor use consistently?

### Output
Per-domain on-page pattern summary.

---

## Phase 6: Technical Signals and Comparative Matrix

### Objective
Assess technical SEO signals and produce the final comparative matrix.

1. **Technical signals per domain:**
   - Sitemap quality (XML sitemap found, last modified date, URL count)
   - Schema diversity (how many schema types used)
   - HTTPS: yes/no
   - Mobile-first indicators (viewport meta present in sampled pages)
   - Hreflang (if multilingual signals detected)
   - Redirect quality (any sampled URLs that 301/302?)

2. **Comparative matrix** — one row per domain (including baseline if provided). Use the full template in `reference.md` § Comparative Matrix Template:

| Metric | Baseline | Competitor 1 | Competitor 2 | … |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Indexed pages (est.) | | | | |
| Estimated organic traffic | | | | |
| Referring domains | | | | |
| Authority score | | | | |
| Schema types used | | | | |
| Has XML sitemap | | | | |
| Top content cluster | | | | |
| Content gap vs baseline | | | | |

3. **Strategic summary:** where is the baseline domain ahead, where is it behind, and what are the 3 highest-leverage competitive actions to take?

### Output
Technical signals table + comparative matrix + strategic summary.

---

## Output Format

Use the template at `templates/output-template.md`. Full audit report is one markdown document per competitor run.

---

## Behavioural Rules

1. **Data sources must be named.** Every metric must have a source (SerpAPI, DataForSEO, direct crawl, estimated). Never present data without attribution.
2. **Approximate vs exact counts.** `site:` query counts are approximate — always note this. DataForSEO traffic estimates are modelled — always note this.
3. **Quick scan vs full audit gates.** If the user selected "quick scan", complete only Phases 1–3. Do not run Phases 4–6 unless asked.
4. **Domain limit.** Default maximum is 5 competitors per run. For more, recommend running two separate passes and merging the matrices.
5. **Baseline domain is optional but valuable.** If no baseline is provided, produce per-competitor reports without comparison columns.
6. **Backlink data is a snapshot.** DataForSEO backlink data has a crawl lag. Do not characterise link profiles as current — use "as of last DataForSEO crawl".
7. **No competitor disparagement.** Report facts and metrics. Do not editorially mock or belittle competitor quality — keep tone professional.
8. **Australian English throughout.** AUD, DD/MM/YYYY, Australian spelling.
9. **Strategic summary is mandatory.** Every full audit must end with a strategic summary — the 3 highest-leverage actions. Do not omit it.
10. **Flag credential requirements.** DataForSEO requires API credentials. If unavailable, note which sections are affected and offer to produce an LLM-estimated version clearly marked as such.

---

## Edge Cases

1. **Competitor domain is inaccessible** — note the HTTP error, attempt `site:` query anyway, and continue with available data. Flag the limitation prominently.
2. **No DataForSEO credentials** — produce Phases 1–2 from SerpAPI only. Clearly mark all keyword and backlink metrics as unavailable. Offer a best-effort qualitative assessment.
3. **Competitor domain is a massive authority site** (e.g. news.com.au) — note that direct comparison is not meaningful. Focus the report on the specific sub-section relevant to the client's market.
4. **Multiple competitors with overlapping content** — use the matrix to highlight where two competitors are fighting for the same traffic. This is a market-structure insight.
5. **Baseline domain has no sitemap** — proceed with `site:` query estimates for the baseline. Note the limitation.
6. **User provides a list of > 5 domains** — audit the first 5, flag that the rest were not audited, and offer to run a second pass.
7. **Domain is new (< 6 months old)** — note low data availability. DataForSEO may have sparse data. Reduce expectations and focus on qualitative pattern analysis from sampled pages.
