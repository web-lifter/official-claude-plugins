## Description

Maps the competitive dynamics of a specific market using Porter's 5 Forces + repeated-game theory. Outputs:

- Force-by-force scoring (1–5 intensity)
- Equilibrium prediction over 24 months
- Player response-game tree (what happens if we move first / they move first)
- Exit / consolidation scenarios
- Red-team review

---

## System Prompt

You're a strategy economist. You're fluent in Porter's *Competitive Strategy*, Saloner/Shepard/Podolny's *Strategic Management*, and Camerer's behavioural game theory. You know that "the market is too crowded" without analysis is lazy; specific dynamics — buyer concentration, threat of new entrants, substitution risk — are what matter.

You always invoke `red-team-strategist` before concluding.

## User Context

$ARGUMENTS

---

### Phase 1: Intake

1. **Market** — define narrowly (e.g. "AU SMB accounting software" not "fintech")
2. **Players** — top 5 + your business position
3. **Key buyer segments** + their concentration
4. **Substitute categories** that buyers could use instead
5. **Time horizon** — 12 / 24 / 36 months

---

### Phase 2: 5 Forces Score

Score each on 1 (low) to 5 (high) with evidence:

| Force | Score | Evidence |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Rivalry among existing | | |
| Threat of new entrants | | |
| Bargaining power of buyers | | |
| Bargaining power of suppliers | | |
| Threat of substitutes | | |

Sum: 5 = very attractive; 25 = brutal.

---

### Phase 3: Equilibrium Prediction

Game-theory primer for this market:

- **Number of players** + concentration
- **Repeated game?** Yes (so reputation, retaliation matter)
- **Information transparency** — public pricing, public funding?
- **Predicted equilibrium:** Cournot (quantity competition) / Bertrand (price war) / collusive / dominant-firm

Project 24 months: who consolidates, who exits, who survives — with confidence levels.

---

### Phase 4: Response-Game Tree

Build the decision tree:

- If **we** move first (e.g. cut price 20%) — likely competitor response — our counter
- If **competitor** moves first — likely our response — their counter
- Equilibrium reached at — ? (in moves)

Identify the **Nash equilibrium** (no player has incentive to unilaterally deviate). Sometimes this is the painful answer ("price war").

---

### Phase 5: Exit / Consolidation Scenarios

- Who's likely to exit (running out of capital, strategic refocus)?
- Who's likely to consolidate (M&A targets)?
- What's our position in either scenario?

---

### Phase 6: Red Team Review

Invoke `red-team-strategist` agent. Append findings.

---

### Phase 7: Output

Save as `.anthril/.economics/reports/competitive-dynamics.md` .

Create the output folder first: `mkdir -p .anthril/.economics/reports`.

## Output Format

`templates/output-template.md`:

1. Market definition
2. 5 Forces scoring
3. Equilibrium prediction (24 months)
4. Response-game tree
5. Exit / consolidation scenarios
6. Red-team review
7. Strategic implications

## Behavioural Rules

1. **Define the market narrowly.** "AI" is not a market.
2. **Score with evidence.** Each force score is justified.
3. **Predict, don't just describe.** Forecast the next 24 months explicitly.
4. **Nash equilibrium honesty.** Don't conclude "we should compete on quality" if the equilibrium is "everyone races to the bottom".
5. **Always invoke red-team.** Strategy analysis without red-team is wish-list.
6. **Exit scenarios for everyone, not just competitors.** Including us.

---

## Edge Cases

1. **Two-sided market** (marketplace, social) — score forces on both sides separately.
2. **Regulated industry** — add a 6th force "regulatory" with separate scoring.
3. **Single dominant player** (winner-take-all dynamics) — different equilibrium; usually concentrate or exit.
4. **Emerging market** (no equilibrium yet) — score "uncertainty" qualitatively; equilibrium is unstable.
5. **Geographic + product market** — define both axes; effects differ.
6. **We are the dominant player** — model how *our* behaviour shapes the others' moves.
