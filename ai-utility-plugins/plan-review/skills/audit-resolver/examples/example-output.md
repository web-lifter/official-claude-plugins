## Plan (triage from Phase 2)

| Order | ID | Strategy | Sub-skill (if applicable) | Depends on |
|-------|----|----------|---------------------------|------------|
| 1 | F001 | AUTO | — | — |
| 2 | F002 | AUTO | — | — |
| 3 | F003 | AUTO | — | — |
| 4 | F004 | AUTO | — | — |
| 5 | F005 | AUTO | — | F006 (paths cluster) |
| 6 | F006 | AUTO | — | — |
| 7 | F008 | AUTO | — | — |
| 8 | F009 | AUTO | — | — |
| 9 | F011 | AUTO | — | — |
| 10 | F010 | PLAN-FIRST | — | F001–F009 (cleanup first; new examples land cleaner) |
| 11 | F007 | PLAN-FIRST | — | F005 (path standard first) |

Severity filter applied: `critical,warning,suggestion` (default). Phase filter: none.

Triage notes:
- F001–F003 batched as a single dangling-ref sweep (cluster by category)
- F004–F006 + F008–F009 + F011 batched as "frontmatter + template convention sweep" (single Python pass)
- F007 + F010 separated as PLAN-FIRST because they introduce new files
